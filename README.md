# Second-bootcamp challenge Portfolio
This is the second bootcamp challenge/assignment. This assignment is focused on creating an portfolio website that is responsive.

## Description

This was the second bootcamp challenge. It's purpose was to create a portfolio website that can be viewed on multiple devices such as tablets and mobiles. The assessment criteria was as follows:

-When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you

-When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

-When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications

-When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others

-When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application

-When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

Learning to create a portfolio was an extremely useful task. In the future, I will be able to alter the website to display all of my work. The website currently only displays my challenges from the bootcamp since those are the only deployed projects I have. 
I have leanred how to make websites responsive. I must admit, the task was not an easy one given the different screen sizes and dimentions but I managed to persevere!

This was an incredibly useful task!
